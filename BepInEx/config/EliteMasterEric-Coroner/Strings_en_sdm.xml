            Translation Notes:
            This is the default localization file for Coroner.
            
            By default, any of the `FunnyNote` or `Death` strings are dynamically chosen at random.
            If the `SeriousDeathMessages` option is enabled, the first `Death` message found in the file is used,
                so make this one literal and specific.
            The other ones can be puns or jokes, and options can be added or removed as needed, just make sure
                to keep the correct tags, and make sure that there is at least one message for each `Death` type.
