# Spectate Enemies v2.6.0
## by alltoasters
https://github.com/EBro912/SpectateEnemies


### Installation
Requires the latest version of [BepInEx 5](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) and [InputUtils](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Rune580/LethalCompany_InputUtils/). After both have been installed, drag `SpectateEnemy.dll` into the `BepInEx/plugins` folder in the game's root directory.

### Usage
When dead, pressing your "Swap" key (default: E) will swap between spectating players and spectating enemies. When spectating either side, you can left click to move to the next player or enemy as normal. The mod will also remember your last spectated enemy, as long as they are still alive.

Pressing your "Flashlight" key (default: RMB) will toggle a flashlight on your spectator camera to see enemies and players better in the dark.

Pressing the "Zoom Out/Zoom In" keys (default: Scroll Wheel) while spectating an enemy will zoom the camera in and out. This can help with bigger enemies that are hard to see at default zoom.

### Keybinds
You can set your keybinds in the in-game keybind menu. The following SpectateEnemies keybinds correspond to these default controls:

"Swap between Players/Enemies" : E
"Open Config Menu" : Insert
"Toggle Flashlight" : Right Button
"Zoom Out" : Scroll Wheel Down
"Zoom In" : Scroll Wheel Up

### Config Menu
Pressing your "Menu" key (default: Insert) will open the config menu. Clicking the box next to an enemy's name will enable/disable spectating that enemy.

You can also find a config in `BepInEx/configs/SpectateEnemy.cfg`, although I wouldn't mess with this file unless you know what you're doing.

If you would like to hide the controls tooltip on the right side of the screen, open the config file and change the `Hide Controls` option to `true`.

### API for Developers
You can utilize the SpectateEnemies API to gather information about what SpectateEnemies is doing for use in your own mod. After adding `SpectateEnemy.dll` as a reference to your project, you can use the `SpectateEnemiesAPI` class to access the API functions.

Currently, three pieces of information are exposed:

`SpectateEnemiesAPI.IsLoaded : bool`
Returns if SpectateEnemies is loaded and ready to run, useful as a sanity check before you start querying other SpectateEnemies functions.

`SpectateEnemiesAPI.IsSpectatingEnemies : bool`
Returns true if the player is spectating an enemy, or false if the player is spectating another player

`SpectateEnemiesAPI.CurrentEnemySpectating() : GameObject`
Returns the `GameObject` of the enemy that the player is spectating. This is the parent object, so you can access information such as the `EnemyAI` component.

Example Usage:
```
if (SpectateEnemiesAPI.IsSpectatingEnemies) {
   GameObject enemy = SpectateEnemiesAPI.CurrentEnemySpectating();
   Debug.Log(enemy.GetComponent<EnemyAI>().enemyType.enemyName);
}
// Prints: Flowerman
```

#### Custom Enemies
If you are creating custom enemies in your mod, they **MUST** have an `EnemyType` for SpectateEnemies to be able to find it. Otherwise, the mod will be unable to spectate your enemy. If you do not want your enemy to be spectatable, ensure they do not have an associated `EnemyType`. (A better solution for stopping enemies from being spectated is planned for the future)
