# loaforcsSoundAPI
A portable sound-replacement mod, built to give sound pack creators more control and a more maintainable code base.

loaforcsSoundAPI may still break occasionally purely because of how much it needs to handle, although game updates are very unlikely to break it. loaforcsSoundAPI will work with most other BepInEx Mono unity games.

## For Sound-Pack creators
A [simple tutorial](https://github.com/LoafOrc/loaforcsSoundAPI/wiki/Making-a-simple-Sound%E2%80%90Pack) to make a sound pack is available in the github wiki.
A couple [examples](https://github.com/LoafOrc/loaforcsSoundAPI-examples) are avaliable as well.

- Custom File Structure Hierachy
- Mapping multiple sounds to the same sounds
- Sound-packs can create config options just like regular mods
- Swap out audio clips live based on what is happening ingame.
