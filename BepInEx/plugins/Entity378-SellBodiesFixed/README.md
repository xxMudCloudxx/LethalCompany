## Sell Bodies Fixed
This is an updated and fixed version of the Sell Bodies mod.\
Original author of the mod: https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/malco/SellBodies/

## Support Me
If you like this mod and feel generous you can support me through "Buy Me a Coffee": https://buymeacoffee.com/entity378

## Config
In the config you can change the amount of credits the bodies are worth, the weight of the bodies, if the bodies are one-handed or two-handed and which mobs can spawn bodies **(modded enemies are supported)**.\
**This mod does not and will never support the following enemies: Masked, Butler and Earth Leviathan.**\
Even enemies that aren't normally killable have bodies/drops, this was done in case someone created a mod capable of killing those enemies.\
**If you don't have ways to kill the vanilla unkillable enemies, those bodies/drops will be unobtainable.**

## Something To Say
It's been 6 months since I started updating the mod and now we are at almost 1M downloads, first of all I wanted to thank all the people who downloaded and supported the mod. However I wanted to communicate that from now on the mod will not provide updates that are not bugfixes (or if the vanilla game updates), the choice comes from the fact that I have other projects in development and I would like to focus on those.

## Known Issues
- The configs are not fully synced, so please make sure all players have the same configs.
